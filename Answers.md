1. What does it mean to think in react?

    -	It means to think about all of the pieces of data and what you want to happen to them.



1. Describe state.

    - State holds info about the component, however the information is handled differently. It is created in the component.


1. Describe props.

    - It is short for properties and it’s passed into the component and it can also be seen as arguments. 


1. What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to state or prop changes?


    - They are anything that affects something outside the scope of the function being executed. They are synced by passing in a dependency array as the second argument to the effect hook.
